This repository hosts the **MyTvRemote** application and supporting assets.

## Repository contents
- `MyTvRemote/` – source code, documentation, and distribution collateral for the remote-control application.
- `README.md` – the repository overview you are reading now.
- `.gitignore` – ignore rules that keep build, dependency, and environment artifacts out of version control.

## Getting started
1. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MyTvRemote
   ```
2. Install dependencies (requires npm registry access):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Execute the automated test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

For offline transfers, decode the bundled `MyTvRemote.tar.gz.base64` file inside the `MyTvRemote/` directory following the instructions in `MyTvRemote/README.md`.
