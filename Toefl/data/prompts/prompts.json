Explain why you\nthink so.”\nConsidering the evolving landscape of higher education, I see online learning as a valuable option but not\na complete replacement for traditional classroom settings. I have taken several online courses while\nstudying in Berlin, where the flexible schedule helped me manage both my studies and part-time work.\nHowever, I missed the immediate feedback and lively discussions that occur during face-to-face classes. I\nagree with Ben that the lack of direct interaction can hinder the development of soft skills that are often\nbuilt through spontaneous group work. I think that online learning must evolve to create more engaging\nand interactive environments that simulate the benefits of in-person education. Enhanced virtual\nclassrooms with real-time collaboration tools could help close this gap, making the online experience more\neffective for students.\n37.\n“Given these changes, do you believe that automation will ultimately benefit or harm workers? Explain why you\nthink so?”\nIn my opinion, automation will end up harming workers ten or twenty years down the road. My personal\nbelief is that when a company has a choice between compensating an employee or utilizing cheap\ntechnology, the company will almost always choose to use technology. For example, the car manufacturing\nindustry used to employ tens of thousands of workers, but due to advances in technology, the workforce\nhas been reduced to a fraction of what it was fifty years ago. While Juan raised a relevant point about\nefficiency leading to the creation of new jobs, I believe he is missing a critical idea. To be more specific,\nhigh-skilled jobs like programming and game design are already disappearing due to the advent of AI\ntechnology that can do the same job for almost nothing.\n38.\n“What do you think? Do you believe the impact of social media on society is predominantly positive or negative?\nExplain why you think so.”\nFrankly, I lean toward the view that the negative effects of social media outweigh its benefits. I agree with\nBen's concerns about the platforms promoting unrealistic standards that can trigger anxiety and\ndepression. During my first year studying abroad in Germany, I spent countless hours scrolling through\nInstagram, which left me feeling inadequate and drained. I vividly recall one period when the constant\n28\nFree Writing Practice 2026\nFor the TOEFL® Writing Section\nbarrage of perfect lifestyles and curated images made me question my own achievements, ultimately\naffecting my sleep and self-esteem. Moreover, I encountered instances of misleading information on\nFacebook that spread rapidly without proper fact-checking, resulting in confusion about local events. Such\nexperiences have taught me that while social media connects people, it can also distort reality and create\nunhealthy expectations.\n39.\n“Before our next class, I want you to respond to the following question: Do you believe schools should integrate\nmore music-focused classes into their curriculum? Why or why not?”\nI firmly believe that schools should integrate more music-focused classes into their curriculum. I support\nAlice's view that music not only sharpens cognitive abilities but also boosts emotional and social skills. In\nhigh school, I joined the school band, and this experience had a lasting impact on me. I noticed that\npracticing regularly improved my memory and concentration during exams. My music teacher, Mr.\nJohnson, encouraged us to experiment with different styles, which sparked creativity and helped me learn\nhow to work effectively with others. I also formed strong friendships with fellow band members during\nrehearsals and performances, which improved my communication skills and confidence. Although I\nunderstand why Ben is concerned about music classes putting a strain on financial resources, my own\nexperience shows that investing in music classes enriches a student's life and provides benefits that\nextend well beyond academics.\n40.\n“Some believe this shift makes transactions more convenient and secure, while others argue that a cashless\nsociety has drawbacks, such as privacy concerns and the exclusion of those without digital access. To what\nextent do you believe that a cashless society is the best way forward?”\nI support a fully cashless society because digital transactions make everyday life simpler and safer. In my\nexperience, using mobile payments in a modern shopping mall in New Delhi was quick and easy. Not\nhandling physical cash means there is less risk of theft or loss, and transactions become more efficient\nduring busy shopping hours. I’ve also read that countries like Sweden have embraced cashless systems,\nwhich have reduced crime and streamlined economic activities. Digital payments offer clear records that\nhelp both consumers and businesses manage their finances better. Although some worry about privacy\nissues or excluding those who are not tech-savvy, I believe that with proper education and secure systems,\nthese concerns can be resolved.\n29",
